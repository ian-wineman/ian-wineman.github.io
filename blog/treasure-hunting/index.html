      “If you read no other book in your life, this is the one.” This is praise for <i>Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned</i> that I stumbled across <a href="https://twitter.com/semiDL/status/1336777823273402368">online</a>. I ended up buying and reading <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-15524-1">the book</a>, and I am very glad I did.

      The primary thrust of the book is that objectives are ineffective (and deceptive) when pursuing ambitious goals and that they must instead be pursued via a non-objective search process.<sup id="ref1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> This essentially amounts to exploring in the direction that you feel is the most interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catch is that although non-objective search can lead to great achievements, we cannot be sure of what they might be.

      The authors frequently cite vacuum tubes and the first computers as an example of non-objective search in the arena of technological innovation. Vacuum tubes were a crucial stepping stone to the first computers, however vacuum tubes were originally developed to study electricity, not for anything related to computers.

      The authors describe this process of non-objective search as treasure hunting or stepping-stone collecting. The value of collecting stepping-stones is also a central theme in Abraham Flexner’s <i><a href="https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/library/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf">The Usefullness of Useless Knowledge</a></i>.

      In a succinct<sup id="ref2"><a href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> (135 pgs) and jargon free book the authors provide—essentially in the form of an algorithm—perhaps the best and most readily applicable advice for any ambitious person brooding over how they might achieve something great.
